1. the main challenge I faced was downloading the files on my computer, as I have never worked like this before. It was good because I learned something new (with the help of AI). AI told me how to solve the problem, and I applied it which I think was a success.
As I said already the main help in solving the task came from AI. Whenever I was stuck on something I didn't know how to solve, I asked AI and it did more than just giving me the result, it also explained it., which I think is the most important aspect when using AI.
